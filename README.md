# Pig game (Two-Dice)

It is a simple dice game in which players take turns to roll two dice as many times as they wish, adding the sum of their dice to a turn score but losing their gained score for the turn if they rolled a 1 in any dice, and the turn ends. If the player rolls two 1s, the total score is lost, and the turn ends. The first player to score 200 or more points wins.
